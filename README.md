# CAT-DOG-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
A Machine learning (Deep Learning) project on ```Cat v/s Dog image classification``` using ```CNN```, ```VGG-16``` and ```VGG-19``` in Python.
- ```Link to the dataset``` : https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/E/1/3E1C3F21-ECDB-4869-8368-6DEBA77B919F/kagglecatsanddogs_5340.zip
- The Dataset consists of 12500 images of Cat and 12500 images of Dog.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
- It is advised to run the notebook in ```Google colab```, as colab provides ```GPU``` which lessens the training time of the algorithm.
- Also colab is inbuilt with all of the required python pip packages, thereby saving your time to install these packages on your local system.
- To run the notebook in your native pc, just change the paths of image folders accordingly.
- To use the ```TestImages```, upload the test images folders to your drive and give the path accordingly.
- A brief description of all the 3 algorithms namely ```CNN```, ```VGG-16``` and ```VGG-19``` are available in the presentations uploaded. (Both part 1 and part 2). Explanation on methods to approach the problem, result analysis of all the 3 algorithms are provided in these presentations as well.
- All the codes are documented for deeper understanding.
